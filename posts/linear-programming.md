[Linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) is an algorithm that solves the general problem of maximizing
a linear outcome given linear constraints. This includes the very broad category of problems "Given a limited of resources, objectives using those resources, and a value for each objective, how can I output objectives to maximize value?". What exactly does this mean though, and how can we solve these kinds of problems? Let's go over it, using skating downhill as an analogy to
help us understand both what these problems look like and what solving them looks like.

## ToC

## Example linear programming problem with terms

As an example problem, we will try to figure out how much
ale and bread we should produce given a limited amount of ingredients
to maximize profits.

Take the following tables listing the recipes of ale and bread, their
selling prices, and the amount of ingredients we have.

<div class="flex-horizontal">

| Product | Corn | Wheat | Sugar |
| ------- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Ale     | 1    | 1     | 2     |
| Bread   | 1    | 4     | 1     |

| Product | Profit |
| ------- | ------ |
| Ale     | 4      |
| Bread   | 5      |

| Ingredient | Amount |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Corn       | 4      |
| Wheat      | 12     |
| Sugar      | 9      |

</div>

### Constraints

The **constraints** in this problem, given the amount of ingredients we have and how much ingredients you need to produce ale $$A$$ and bread $$B$$, are the following:

<div class="small-text">

| Ingredient | Used per $$A$$ | Used per $$B$$ | Amount | Constraint       |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| Corn       | 1              | 1              | 4      | $$A + B ≤ 4$$    |
| Wheat      | 1              | 4              | 12     | $$A + 4B ≤ 12$$  |
| Sugar      | 2              | 1              | 6      | $$2A + B ≤ 9$$   |
|            |                |                |        | $$A ≥ 0, B ≥ 0$$ |

</div>

Each constraint makes sure we don't use more of any ingredient than we have.
Additionally, we also constrain on producing a nonnegative amount of either product.

### Optimality function

The **optimality function** for a problem describes the value
of a solution, in this case, the amount of profit we make $$P$$.
Given $$A$$ sells for 4 and $$B$$ for 5:

| $$4A + 5B = P$$ |
| --------------- |

### Solutions and feasible solutions

A **solution** would consist of the amount of $$A$$ and $$B$$ you want to produce. A **feasible solution** is one that
satisfies our constraints.

For example, some feasible solutions for this problem:

- $$A=1, B=1$$: uses 2 corn, 5 wheat, 3 sugar
- $$A=0, B=0$$: uses no ingredients

and some infeasible solutions:

- $$A=-1, B=0$$: we can't produce negative of a product
- $$A=0, B=4$$: uses 16 wheat, more than the 12 we have

### Feasible region

The set of feasible solutions for a problem is called the **feasible region**.

## The feasible region as a skating rink

To illustrate how linear programming works, we will use
a skating rink as an analogy. In this scenario,
an inclined plane will represent our solution space, with
the incline of the plane matching the optimality function.
Lower down represents more optimal/profitable solutions.

<img src="/images/linear_programming/graph_tilting.gif" alt="Plane tilting according to optimality function" />

Ideally we would skate down hill forever and make infinite money.
However, each of our constraints divides our plane into a feasible
section of solutions and an infeasible section.
Because each of our constraints are linear and divide our solution space
using straight lines, they combine
to section our hill into a convex polygon of feasible solutions: the feasible region, aka our skating rink:

<img src="/images/linear_programming/constraints_appearing.gif" alt="Constraints popping in to section skate rink into feasible region" />

We'll use the term "constraint" to equivalently mean the borders depicted above through this article.

<details><summary>When will the feasibility region be a convex polygon?</summary>

Linear constraints will generally lead to one of 3 cases:

1. An unbounded feasible region, like our region above before we add the 3rd constraint. **No guaranteed optimal solution** as we may be able to continue in a direction forever.
2. A feasible region that is a convex polygon. **Always solvable using linear programming**.
3. No feasible region. This could occur if we added in a constraint that covered our entire feasible region. **No solution in this case**.

</details>

<details><summary>What does "linear" mean exactly?</summary>

"Linear" in math describes an equation where variables have only
constant coefficients:

- Linear: $$10 = 5b + 2c$$
- Linear: $$8 ≥ b + 0.5c$$
- Not linear: $$4 = b^2 + c$$
- Not linear: $$5 = log(b)$$

Our example problem is linear as the amount of ingredients used and the profit we make scales linearly with the amount of products produced, allowing us to express each part of the problem as a [linear expression](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/linear-equations/). If something funky happened like the profit per product going down with higher production (maybe you satisfy all the demand for bread), linear programming would not be applicable. Knowing a problem is linear makes it easier to solve.

</details>

### Two key properties of linear programming problems

Because our feasible region
is a convex polygon, and because the optimality function leads
in a constant direction (down hill) no matter where are, we can realize two important
properties of our feasible region:

1. **The optimal solution will always be at one of the corners**. If
   we are in the middle of the feasible region or on a constraint, we can just continue to slide down slope
   to a corner of the region get to a more optimal solution.
2. **We will never get stuck in an inset portion of the
   region moving downhill unless it is the optimal solution**. This
   is due to the region being convex.

If we
were to drop a ball anywhere in our rink, it would naturally fall down
to the optimal point due to the above properties:

<img src="/images/linear_programming/ball_rolling.gif" alt="Ball rolling" />

The linear programming algorithm will involve traveling downhill along the perimeter of the feasible region until we can travel downhill
no further, at which point we know we are the optimal solution.

## Skating our way to the solution

### Picking a starting point

To find an optimal solution, we will use as a starting off point
any corner of the feasible region, grabbing onto both the constraints
forming the corner. We will
start at $$(A=0, B=0)$$ as it is an easy corner to come up with.

<img src="/images/linear_programming/starting_point.png" alt="Robot standing at point A=0, B=0">

### Skating downhill

From our starting point, we will travel downhill along constraints
until we land at the lowest corner. Each step of our process will involve the following:

1. Pick a constraint we are holding onto that we can push off of
   to go downhill. If we can push multiple ways to go downhill, we
   can choose either direction arbitrarily, as moving downhill in any direction is bringing us closer to the solution and we [don't need to worry about getting stuck in a non-optimal corner](#two-key-properties-of-linear-programming-problems).
2. Figure out which corner we will land at after pushing.
3. Push off the constraint and land gracefully at the new corner.

<img src="/images/linear_programming/step2.gif" alt="Performing a step by pushing off the ale constraint and landing at the sugar constraint">

We continue to do the above until we can no longer travel
downhill by pushing off of a constraint, which will only happen
after arriving at the optimal solution.

### The entire skating process

Our process then is the following:

1. Pick an initial corner of the feasible region to start at.
2. Continue to do the following as long as you can travel downhill:
   1. Pick a constraint that we can push downhill off of.
   2. Figure out where we will land after pushing off.
   3. Push off the constraint and land at the new corner.
3. Return the final corner we have landed at as the solution.

## Creating variables to represent leftover ingredients

Before we can begin to formalize our skating algorithm, we need to do one step to redefine how we look at our problem.
Currently, our constraints are described as inequalities in terms solely of $$A$$ and $$B$$:

- Corn: $$A + B ≤ 4$$
- Wheat: $$A + 4B ≤ 12$$
- Sugar: $$3A + B ≤ 9$$
- Ale: $$A ≥ 0$$
- Bread: $$B ≥ 0$$

However, this formulation does not make it easy to
pick corners of the feasible region, which we would like to
do as [we know our solution is at one of the corners](#two-key-properties-of-linear-programming-problems).
To facilitate picking corners, we will introduce new variables representing
how much of each ingredient we have leftover to do this.

We will use $$LC, LW, LS$$
as variables representing our leftover corn, wheat, and sugar,
and redefine our inequalities as equalities involving leftovers.
For example, $$A + B + LC = 4$$ means "The amount of corn we're using to produce ale and bread, plus the amount of leftover corn, is equal to our total corn available."

The entire
formulation of our problem now looks like the following:

**Constraints**

- Corn: $$A + B + LC = 5$$
- Wheat: $$A + 4B + LW = 12$$
- Sugar: $$3A + B + LS = 9$$
- $$A ≥ 0$$
- $$B ≥ 0$$
- $$LC ≥ 0$$
- $$LW ≥ 0$$
- $$LS ≥ 0$$

**Optimality Function**

- $$4A + 5B = P$$

In future formulations, we will omit that our variables must be nonnegative and just keep in mind that this is the case.

### Using basises to pick corners

Having variables representing the leftover of each ingredient now means
they represent our distance from the constraints: when the leftover amount of an ingredient is 0 we are on the constraint representing it.
This makes it easy to **select a corner of our feasible region (where
two constraints intersect) by setting any two of our variables two zero.**

We call a choice of two variables we set to 0 arrive at a corner a **basis**, with each **basis**
corresponding to a corner of the feasible region. More generally, a basis could also represent the intersection of two constraints outside of the feasible region, but we
will be careful to stay on the perimeter of the feasible region while skating. Visible basises are labeled below,
with feasible ones being labeled green and unfeasible ones red:

<img src="/images/linear_programming/basises.png" alt="Labeled basises" />

Similar to using "constraint" to refer to an edge, we will also here use "basis" to refer to a corner of the feasible region through the rest of this article.

## Formalizing our skating through math

Given our skating process, let's formalize it using
an actual algorithm.

### Step 1: picking an initial basis to start at

<img src="/images/linear_programming/starting_point.png" alt="Robot standing at point A=0, B=0">

For our Brewer's problem instance:

- $$A + B + LC = 4$$
- $$A + 4B + LW = 12$$
- $$3A + B + LS = 9$$

We need to zero out 2 variables to choose an initial basis to start at. Using basis $$(A, B)$$ gives us a very obvious and obviously feasible solution of the remaining variables, so we will start with those (although you could zero out others if you want to start somewhere else).

We will indicate which variables are currently in our basis
by surrounding them with brackets:

- $$[A] + [B] + LC = 4$$
- $$[A] + [4B] + LW = 12$$
- $$[3A] + [B] + LS = 9$$
- $$[4A] + [5B] = P$$
- Basic variables: $$A = 0, B = 0$$

Resulting in the following values for all our variables:

- Basis variables (must be 0): $$A = 0, B = 0$$
- Non-basis variables: $$LC = 4, LW = 12, LS = 9$$
- $$P = 0$$

Great, we have a solution! However, the issue with this solution
is it is not optimal as we are not making any money.

### Step 2.1: Finding a constraint to push off of

<img src="/images/linear_programming/step21.png" alt="About to push off of ale constraint">

Looking at our optimality function

- $$[4A] + [5B] = P$$

We would rather not zero out the ale and bread we produce as
they contribute to our profit: right now we aren't making any money with both being 0. It would be better to zero out something
like leftover corn, which according to the optimality function doesn't make us any money.

To move
towards a more optimal solution, we look at the optimality function to
find a variable with a positive coefficient, indicating it would
be more profitable to not be 0. We then "push off" of the constraint for it by making it non-0, sliding along
the other constraint we keep in the basis.

We can choose
to take either $$A$$ or $$B$$ out of the basis now, but let's arbitrarily choose $$A$$. Now, we need to figure out which constraint we will land at after pushing off of the $$A$$ constraint.

### Step 2.2: Figuring out where we will land

<img src="/images/linear_programming/land_at_step.png" alt="Plan to land at sugar constraint">

The further we move from the $$A$$ constraint after pushing off, the larger the value of $$A$$ is.
Thus, we can find the first constraint we run into when sliding along the $$B$$ constraint by
finding the other constraint whose intersection with $$B$$ is at the smallest value of $$A$$.

[Finding the intersection of the $$B$$ constraint with another constraint can be done by setting both their variables to 0](#using-basises-to-pick-corners). Looking at our system

1. $$[A] + [B] + LC = 4$$
2. $$[A] + [4B] + LW = 12$$
3. $$[3A] + [B] + LS = 9$$

We get the following values for $$A$$ when we set $$B$$ and another variable to 0.

1. Basis of $$(B, LC)$$: $$A + [B] + [LC] = 4, A = 4$$
2. Basis of $$(B, LW)$$: $$A + [4B] + [LW] = 12, A = 12$$
3. Basis of $$(B, LS)$$: $$3A + [B] + [LS] = 9, A = 3$$

We see here that the $$(B, LS)$$ basis gives the smallest value for A, so we know
$$(B, LS)$$ is the first basis we encounter as we slide along the $$B$$ constraint.

### Step 2.3: Landing gracefully at our new basis

<img src="/images/linear_programming/step23.gif" alt="Plan to land at sugar constraint">

We have figured out the new basis we will land at: $$(B, LS)$$.

- $$A + [B] + LC = 4$$
- $$A + [4B] + LW = 12$$
- $$3A + [B] + [LS] = 9$$
- $$4A + [5B] = P$$

Now all we need to do is reformulate our system of equations
to make steps 2.1 and 2.2 easy to repeat.

[Step 2.1](#step-21-finding-a-constraint-to-push-off-of) was easy because the optimality function made it obvious how
our basis variables contributed to our profit, and we would like this to again be obvious for our new basis.
To achieve this, we will use [elimination](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:systems-of-equations/x2f8bb11595b61c86:solving-systems-elimination/a/elimination-method-review) to remove our now non-basis variable $$A$$ from our current phrasing of the optimality function, replacing it with our new basis variable $$LS$$ to get an optimality function in terms only of our basis variables:

|                                        |
| -------------------------------------: |
|                    $$(4A + [5B] = P)$$ |
|    − $$(4/3) * (3A + [B] + [LS] = 9)$$ |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ |
|     $$[(11/3)B] - [(4/3)LS] = P - 12$$ |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ |
|     $$[(11/3)B] - [(4/3)LS] + 12 = P$$ |

Now two things are obvious again:

1. Our profit given both $$B$$ and $$LS$$ being 0 is 12. Better than our profit of 0 from before, our process is working!
2. $$LS$$ would not contribute to the profit as it is negative in the optimality function. However, $$B$$ still would contribute to our profit as it is positive: this is the constraint we will want to push off of next.

We can use the same process to simplify our other equations:

<details><summary>Simplifying the other equations</summary>

Given our equations

- $$A + [B] + LC = 4$$
- $$A + [4B] + LW = 12$$
- $$3A + [B] + [LS] = 9$$

|                                        |
| -------------------------------------: |
|                 $$(A + [B] + LC = 4)$$ |
|    − $$(1/3) * (3A + [B] + [LS] = 9)$$ |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ |
|    $$-[(1/3)LS] + [(2/3)B]  + LC = 1$$ |

|                                        |
| -------------------------------------: |
|               $$(A + [4B] + LW = 12)$$ |
|    − $$(1/3) * (3A + [B] + [LS] = 9)$$ |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ |
|    $$-[(1/3)LS] + [(11/3)B] + LW = 9$$ |

|                                        |
| -------------------------------------: |
|      $$(1/3) * (3A + [B] + [LS] = 9)$$ |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ |
|       $$[(1/3)LS] + [(1/3)B] + A = 3$$ |

</details>

- $$-[(1/3)LS] + [(2/3)B] + LC = 1$$
- $$-[(1/3)LS] + [(11/3)B] + LW = 9$$
- $$[(1/3)LS] + [(1/3)B] + A = 3$$
- $$-[(4/3)LS] + [(11/3)B] + 12 = P$$

### Step 3: returning the solution

<details><summary> Repeating step 2 twice more to get to the optimal solution </summary>

We repeat step 2 two more times to get to the optimal solution. First, because B is positive in the optimality function,
taking B out of the basis and LC in to get to:

- $$[(3/2)LC] - [(1/2)LS] + B = (3/2)$$
- $$-[(11/2)LC] + [(3/2)LS] + LW = (7/2)$$
- $$-[(1/2)LC] + [(1/2)LS] + A = (5/2)$$
- $$-[(11/2)LC] + [(1/2)LS] + (35/2) = P$$

and then, because LS is now positive in the optimality function,
taking LS out of the basis and LW in to get:

- $$[(7/6)LC] + [(1/3)LW] + B = (8/3)$$
- $$-[(11/3)LC] + [(2/3)LW] + LS = (7/3)$$
- $$[(4/3)LC] - [(1/3)LW] + A = (4/3)$$
- $$-[(11/3)LC] - [(2/3)LW] + (56/3) = P$$

</details>

<img src="/images/linear_programming/at_end.png" alt="Robot at the optimal point">

Eventually, we reach a form of the optimality function where
none of the variables in the basis are contributing to the profit, at basis $$(LC, LW)$$.

- $$[(7/6)LC] + [(1/3)LW] + B = (8/3)$$
- $$-[(11/3)LC] + [(2/3)LW] + LS = (7/3)$$
- $$[(4/3)LC] - [(1/3)LW] + A = (4/3)$$
- $$-[(11/3)LC] - [(2/3)LW] + (56/3) = P$$

This means we are most optimally producing
products by using up all of our corn and wheat, with some sugar
remaining that we don't do anything with. We can
return the current values we have as our optimal solution:

- $$A=4/3$$
- $$B=8/3$$
- $$P=56/3$$

## Conclusion

Hopefully our skating analogy made it clear what linear programming
is doing: navigating downhill (in the direction of the optimality function)
along edges of the feasible region (constraints), evaluating corners (basises) of the region
until we reach a point where we can't go downhill any further (the optimal solution). While the implementation of the
algorithm itself
can seem be a bit cumbersome (mainly our step to [reorganize stuff](#step-23-landing-gracefully-at-our-new-basis)), in reality what it's doing is quite simple: moving downhill along the edges until it gets to the solution.

<details><summary>Applying linear programming in higher dimensions</summary>

Because our example problem had only two objectives (ale and bread),
this resulted in two axes of our solution space, making the problem
two dimensional. Very often though, we will have more that two objectives. Even in higher dimensions, the process would still
be the same: follow the objective function along constraints towards corners of the
feasible region until we can't follow it any further. In this case,
the feasible region would not be a 2d polygon but a multidimensional [polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope),
but there's no reason why our algorithm would break in higher dimensions.
